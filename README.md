# Detailed Comments and Theory on the Code

## Theory Behind the Code

This program analyzes motion involving **collision** and **braking** scenarios. It calculates collision outcomes (velocities and energy lost) and evaluates braking forces using the work-energy principle.

Key features include:

1. **Collision Analysis**:
   - Solves for final velocities using conservation of momentum and the coefficient of restitution.
   - Computes energy lost during the collision.
2. **Braking Analysis**:
   - Calculates braking force using the work-energy principle.
   - Visualizes velocity changes over braking distance.
3. **Dynamic Visualization**:
   - Provides interactive plots for collision and braking data.
   - Allows users to adjust parameters like initial velocity and braking distance dynamically.

## Theory of Collision and Braking

### Collision Analysis:

- **Conservation of Momentum**:
  Plain Text: m1 * v1i + m2 * v2i = m1 * v1f + m2 * v2f

  Solves for final velocities (v1f, v2f) after collision.

- **Coefficient of Restitution**:
  Plain Text: e = (v2f - v1f) / (v1i - v2i)

  Defines the elasticity of the collision.

- **Energy Loss**:
  Plain Text: Energy Lost = KE_initial - KE_final

  Computes the change in kinetic energy during the collision.

### Braking Analysis:

- **Work-Energy Principle**:
  Plain Text: F * s = 0.5 * m * (v1i^2 - v1f^2)

  Calculates the braking force (F) required to stop or decelerate a vehicle over distance (s).

- **Velocity Profile**:
  Plots velocity changes from v1i to v1f over the braking distance.

## Differences from Previous Versions

1. **Interactive Visualization**:
   - This version incorporates dynamic plots using Matplotlib sliders.
   - Earlier versions lacked interactive elements.

2. **Collision and Braking Combined**:
   - Combines collision analysis with braking force calculations.
   - Earlier versions focused on motion or collision individually.

3. **User Input Flexibility**:
   - Allows partial inputs and assumes defaults for missing values.
   - Enhances usability compared to rigid input requirements in previous versions.

4. **Energy Computations**:
   - Includes energy loss during collisions, a feature absent in earlier implementations.
